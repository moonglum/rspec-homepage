# A proposal for a new RSpec homepage

This is my proposal for a new RSpec homepage. It should be two things at once:

1. A systematic introduction to RSpec for beginners
2. A reference for concepts in RSpec for users of RSpec

It's not supposed to be an API reference, but it should contain links to the corresponding API documentations in each section. It should also contain pointers to external resources like blog posts or videos.
